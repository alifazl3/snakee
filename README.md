## this project developed without AI

this project was an exercise to code like a real developer
even this read me file written by human being and obviously it may contain errors


this code may help you to understand how recursive codes work and what is dfs

## how to play?

eat **reds** to **grow**

**do not** touch dark blue cells

go to light blue cell to **win**

move with `arrow` keys

press `b` to try to solve level

## tech

project structure is too simple to describe
a html file with 2 directories
js, css

### js

look at solver function to understand dfs

dfs is a recursive function that try all possibilities until certain depth and check if it won or not

tbh there are better ways to solve this game but i write this on 5am :)

my goal was to write an algorithm that can generate levels but it take long time if you want ask chat gpt:)

and if you really cares i have this ideas

## Todo:

[ ] generate levels base on some seeds 

[ ] implement sort of rewarding algorithm so branches that contain apples have higher depth 

[ ] write level generator


## trivia / memorial
this code write on 24.25.2025 - 25.12.2025 midnight after my 22th birthday party
